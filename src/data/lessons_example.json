			"title": "Subject-Verb Agreement",
			"explanation": "In English, the verb must agree with its subject in number and person. This means that if the subject is singular, the verb should be singular. If the subject is plural, the verb should be plural. For example, ‘he does,’ but ‘they do.’ Common mistakes often occur with third person singular subjects (he, she, it) where learners may use the base form of the verb instead of the -s/-es ending.",

			"title": "Countable and Uncountable Nouns with Articles",
			"explanation": "In English, some nouns are countable (can be counted: one ticket, two tickets), and others are uncountable (cannot be counted: information, progress). When using articles (‘a’ or ‘an’), they are used only with singular countable nouns. ‘The’ can be used with both. Uncountable nouns should not have ‘a/an’ and are usually singular. Some abstract nouns (like ‘progress’, ‘information’, ‘data’) are uncountable.",
